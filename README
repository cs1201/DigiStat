This project will be a digital thermostat utilising a raspiberry pi for control and relevant temeperature sensing and power relay
components to interface with a traiditional 240V thermostat circuit.


-> CONTROL:
	- Currently intend to run a Raspberry PI Zero W as the control processor, connected to domestic WiFi Network
	- Hoping to use MQTT protocol to allow remote control from web-interface or iOS application
	- SSH login to device for programming/control
	- TFT Touchcreen attached to PI for physcial control at unit
-> ELECTICAL:
	- 3.3v/240V Relay unit to switch on/off heating circuit
	- 240VAC->5VDC Power supply split off incoming 240V circuit
-> SOFTWARE:
	- Main program to be completed in Python, utilising RaspPi GPIO libraries
	- GUI to be created with PyQT
	- iOS/Web Control via MQTT protocol

TO:DO->

- 8th Jan 2019
Setup virtual env and github repo, start collating modules. Download/install PyQT and experiment with GUI Building.
