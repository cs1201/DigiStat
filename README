DIGISTAT
=========
This project will be a digital thermostat utilising a raspiberry pi for control and relevant temeperature sensing and power relay
components to interface with a traiditional 240V thermostat circuit.

-> CONTROL:
	- Currently intend to run a Raspberry PI Zero W as the control processor, connected to domestic WiFi Network
	- Planning to use MQTT protocol to allow remote control from web-interface or iOS application
	- SSH login to device for programming/control
	- TFT Touchcreen attached to PI for physcial control at unit
-> ELECTICAL:
	- 3.3v/240V Relay unit to switch on/off heating circuit
	- 240VAC->5VDC Power supply split off incoming 240V circuit
-> SOFTWARE:
	- Main program to be completed in Python, utilising RaspPi GPIO libraries
	- GUI to be created with PyQT
	- iOS/Web Control via MQTT protocol

TO:DO->

8th Jan 2019
->Setup virtual env and github repo, start collating modules. Download/install PyQT and experiment with GUI Building.

9th Jan 2019
-> Weather integration with HTTP_GET API Call to online weather service
-> Setup stacks to show individual panes
-> Populated calendar pane with QCalendar widget (this probably doesn't need any further functionality)

10th Jan 2019
-> Added automation to auto-hide toolbar, need to set this on click of the area and autohide after certain number of seconds

11th Jan 2019
-> Added matplotlib to App, started formatting but this will need to be refactored into it's own class to keep tidy
-> Always show toolbar when plot is selected to kill deadspace [NEED TO FIX: works when first selected, but ruins autohide schedule when switching back to another stack]
-> Weather API refresh does not need to be on scheduler, this can just be triggered every time the stack is selected, or by refresh button on the stack.
